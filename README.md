I made this small program to help me learn The Soldier's Creed.
The Py file is simply the code I wrote.
The 7z file contains the project as an executable made with pyinstaller.
It splits the creed into each seperate line and compares user input with the current line while providing a simple "Correct" or "Incorrect" feedback until the user gets the line correct.
It then moves to the next line.
Built for no punctuation, so do not worry about periods or commas.
Input automatically changed into lowercase so that capitalization is not an issue.
